## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a regression model that can predict house prices based on various economic and housing-related factors.

Steps covered:
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection  
- Model training using Linear Regression  
- Model evaluation  
- Price prediction  

This project is suitable for beginners and intermediate learners who want to understand regression modeling in machine learning.
